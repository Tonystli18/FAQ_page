# About this project

This project demonstrates how to use Vue and TailwindCSS in laravel framework. It is created after taking laracasts lesson [modern-css-for-backend-developers](https://laracasts.com/series/modern-css-for-backend-developers/episodes/7?autoplay=true). However, because that lesson was published in 2018, if you follow exactly the way in lesson video, it will not work. I'll describe below how I figured out the way to create that FAQ page.

## How to create the project framework?
